### Hello!

My name is Sam and I am an Environmental Data Scientist and Interdisciplinary Ecologist. My experience encompasses a range of projects focused on land cover change, spatial modeling, and the impacts of climate change on environmental health, which have strengthened my skills in coding, ecological field sampling, and laboratory analysis. I’m eager to continue developing my environmental data science skills, leverage my experience to help protect our vital ecosystems, and contribute to environmental justice efforts through accessible science communication.
