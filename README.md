### Hello!

<!--
My name is Sam (he/they) and I am a Masters of Environmental Data Science Student at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I am interested in computational modeling and data visualization to inform ecosystem conservation (especially for plant communities🌱). I'm excited to continue my educational journey in data science and am aiming to work with researchers, conservation biologists, and anyone passionate about conservation and environmental justice issues.

My Experience: 
- 🏫 Bachelors of Science in Biology and Bachelors of Arts in Environmental Studies: St. Mary's College of Mayland, May 2023
- 🌱 Research experience in phenology, plant-microbe interactions, plant genetics, plant-pathogens, oysters, submerged aquatic vegetation, and physical oceanography (all with a climate focus).
- 💬 Ask me about my favorite plants!
